## Running the Project

### Steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Right-click** on the `package.json` file and select **"Open in Integrated Terminal"**.
3. Run the command:

```bash
   npm install
```

This will install the necessary dependencies for the project. 4. In the same terminal, run the following command to start the project:

```bash
nodemon ./src/main.ts
```

**Note:** If you are already in the same directory as the `main.ts` file, you can simplify the command to:

```bash
nodemon main.ts
```

Follow these steps, and the project should be up and running!
